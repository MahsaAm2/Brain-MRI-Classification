# Brain MRI Classification: Normal vs. Abnormal

This project classifies brain MRI images into two categories: normal and abnormal. The dataset, sourced from the [iAAA MRI Challenge](https://github.com/iAAA-event/iAAA-MRI-Challenge), consists of 3,132 MRI scans from 1,044 patients. It includes T1-weighted (T1-W), T2-weighted (T2-W), and FLAIR images, covering various brain diseases such as tumors, Alzheimer's, atrophy, and more.
